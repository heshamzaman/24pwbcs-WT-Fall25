# Lab 01--summary

During this lab, I learned how to create and manage a basic HTML file using Git for version control. I practiced adding and committing files, creating branches, and merging changes. I also learned how to use a `.gitignore` file and add a license to a project. Working with branches helped me understand how experimental changes can be made safely without affecting the main codebase. Overall, this lab gave me hands-on experience with essential Git operations and improved my understanding of version control in web development.
